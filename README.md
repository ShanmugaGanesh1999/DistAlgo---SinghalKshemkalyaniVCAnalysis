# DistAlgo---SinghalKshemkalyaniVCAnalysis

The package consists of 4 class files: 'Message.java', 'Process.java', 'MatrixClock.java', and 'SinghalKshemkalyaniDistributedSystem.java'. The main file is 'SinghalKshemkalyaniDistributedSystem.java', which is responsible for executing the entire algorithm.

To run the algorithm, navigate to the file 'SinghalKshemkalyaniDistributedSystem.java' and execute the main method inside it. This class will effectively utilize the other three classes for execution.
