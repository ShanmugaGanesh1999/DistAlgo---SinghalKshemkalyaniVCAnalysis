For this experiment, we've added 4 lists which will collect the following,
averageLengthMessageConstruction
maximumLengthMessageConstruction
averageLengthMessageUpdation
maximumLengthMessageUpdation

Each action executes, while constructing the message before sending the message to other processes a counter is maintained and will add the number of messages it has in the message. Similarly, for receiving events, we have a counter that tracks the count of messages it updates in its matrix clock.

Before we store it in the array, for all averages we'll count based on the number of processes. Then finally the output is printed and analyzed.



As far as difficulty is concerned, I've encounted issues while implementing. 

I resolved it by visulaizing things and making a clear roadmap.
